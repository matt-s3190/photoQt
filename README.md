# Project Title: PhotoQT
This is a simple photo-editing GUI (Guided User Interface) made in Python using PyQt5, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and Qt Designer (PyQt5's built-in drag-and-drop software). This application allows users to import images with these extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .svg) and customize them through event-driven controls such as buttons and drop-down menus. 
### These transformations include mirroring, rotating, blurring, and built-in filtration by manipulating the image's contrast, saturation, tone and texture and are all fully adjustable by the user. Modifications that are applied to the image gets updated real-time and shown to the user. Once a user is satisfied with their customized image, they are able to save it to an external folder.
