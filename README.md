# Project Title: PhotoQT
A simple photo-editing GUI (Guided User Interface) made in Python using PyQt5, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and Qt Designer (PyQt5's built-in drag-and-drop software). 

# Project Overview
This application allows users to import images with these extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .svg) and customize them through event-driven controls such as buttons and drop-down menus.\
These transformations include mirroring, rotating, blurring, and manipulation of the image's contrast, saturation, tone and texture which are all fully adjustable by the user. Modifications that are applied to the image get updated real-time and is shown to the user. Redo/Undo features are avaiable and save features as well
