# Project Title: PhotoQT
A simple photo-editing GUI (Guided User Interface) made in Python using PyQt5 and PIL (Python Imaging Library). 

# Project Overview
This application allows users to import images with these extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .svg) and customize them through event-driven controls such as buttons and drop-down menus. These transformations include mirroring, rotating, blurring, and manipulation of the image's contrast, saturation, tone and texture. These changes are all fully adjustable by the user. When a change gets applied to the image, the edited image is updated in real time for immediate preview. \
If the image isn't up to the user's standards, there is an undo feature that reverses the modifications.

## Dependencies Used
- Python 3.11+
- PyQt5
- Pillow

# Challenges I've faced

# What I've learned
Things that I learned:
Composition of Classes (Editor Instance within Widget Class)
os Methods
